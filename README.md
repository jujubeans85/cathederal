# Cathedral

This is a containment system.

It exists to:
- hold reality without forcing conclusions
- reduce cognitive load
- prevent night-builds and panic refactors

## Rules
- No machine overwrites source material
- Annotation is always sidecar
- Proof of Concept > completion
- Time is part of the design

## Current State
- Structure defined
- Machines idle
- No automation active

## What This Is Not
- Not a product
- Not a sprint
- Not a dumping ground for ambition

## When to Touch This
- When pressure needs a place to go
- When thinking needs rails
- When synchrony matters more than speed
